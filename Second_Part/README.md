# Second-Part-Basic-Python-Programming-Skill
The second part of my python study was emphasized on software development using object-oriented methodology.

In this part, I have done coding example and coding exercises that focus on learning the following aspects:

• how to analyze and design software.

• how to create reusable software components and to compose programs from already available
components.

• some basic data structures and algorithms and how to match the data structures and algorithms to
problems.

• how to evaluate programs for their functionality and their performance.
